"""
# Script to count some basic structural features of plays, such as acts, scenes, and roles.

###############################
# Overview of functions
###############################

# 1. Load files from a folder.
# 2. For each file containing one play, list the lines.
# 3. For each line, determine whether it is verse, prose, stage or other and store the length of the line in characters.
# 4. For each type, make a list of line lengths.
# 5. Write a CSV file with comma-separated values for: filename, number of verse, prose, stage and other lines as well as percentages.


###############################
# User settings
###############################

# 1. Mandatory: Put all files to be analysed in the subfolder "input" (or change location in main).
# 2. Optional: Adjust the XPath to verse and prose depending on the encoding scheme of your files.
